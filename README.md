I created an web app to track 5 days weather forecast. When users enter a city name, the app presents with that city's today and next 5 days weather forecast with temparature, humidity, windspeed, and a tiny icon of the weather condition. Users can also save the searched history, and click on it to reload the searched cities for later use
